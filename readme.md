# [next-slate](https://next-slate.p.joulev.dev)

A personal experiment. A simple rich text editor with Next.js, [Slate](https://docs.slatejs.org) and [Plate](https://plate.udecode.io). Or at least the part of the Slate and Plate documentations that I can digest and understand within a few hours. Plate probably wins the prize of the most unclear and anti-beginner documentation I've ever read, but having built this for a few hours, I can say these two libraries are really awesome.

A couple more features I'd like to add

- When the dropdown is shown, `DownArrow`, `UpArrow`, `Enter` can be used to change the active button and click them, contrary to the current state where a mouse click is necessary.

- Custom styling for the balloon toolbar. (Why is Plate's `<BalloonToolbar>` unstylable with Tailwind classes?)

- and some more features so that this can at least have some credibility to be called a Notion clone.

I will probably revisit and enhance the app when I have some free time.
